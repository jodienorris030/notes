# 2023-12-04
- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize code readability and maintainability. This means writing concise, well-structured, and easy-to-understand code that can be easily modified and expanded upon as needed. To achieve this, follow these best practices:

1. Use clear variable, function, method, class, module, etc. names that accurately represent their purpose and functionality.
2. Follow coding conventions and standards for the language and framework you're using. These guidelines exist to ensure consistency and ease of understanding across a team. 
3. Break your code into modular, reusable components whenever possible. By doing so, you can more easily maintain, test, document, reuse, or even share your work with others.  
4. Write concise comments that explain the purpose, logic, assumptions, constraints, edge cases, potential errors, unexpected behavior, security considerations, performance optimizations, dependencies, API, usage, examples, caveats, known issues, future plans, alternate implementations, alternative solutions, workarounds, disclaimers, warnings, cautions, notes, tips, tricks, idiosyncrasies, quirks, gotchas, pitfalls, traps, anti-patterns, best-practices, design patterns, architecture, patterns of enterprise application development, principles of software engineering, programming paradigms, software development lifecycle, agile methodology, continuous integration, testing, debugging, profiling, optimization, maintenance, deployment, operations, monitoring, scaling, clustering, virtualization, cloud computing, distributed systems, concurrency, parallelism, asynchrony, event-driven architecture (EDA), reactive programming, functional programming (FP), object-oriented programming  (OOP), procedural programming and more. Your comments should be concise and to the point, but also comprehensive and helpful.   
5. Always write tests and use version control. Testing ensures your software works as intended and is free of defects. Version control allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions, collaborate with teammates, merge code, branch, tag, commit, push, pull, sync, resolve merge conflicts, create patches, submit patches and pull requests, manage projects, track issues and stories, estimate effort, schedule tasks, calculate velocity, plan releases, monitor progress, report status, analyze trends, benchmark performance, optimize resources, troubleshoot problems, diagnose issues or bottlenecks and much more!
6. Continuously learn, grow, adapt, improve, evolve, innovate, experiment, explore, discover, master, understand, apply, practice, teach, share, discuss, debate, critique, evaluate, recommend, implement, integrate, configure, customize, extend, enhance, streamline, simplify, automate, orchestrate, deploy, administer, maintain and support your craft. The more you know and understand about programming languages, frameworks, tools, techniques, methodologies, philosophies and best practice patterns the better you will become as a programmer.

- Today's programming wisdom: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth. 

This quote reminds programmers that while efficiency is crucial, it shouldn't be the primary focus during the early stages of development. It's more important to write clear, maintainable code first and optimize only when necessary, based on profiling and analysis. Overemphasis on premature optimization can lead to complex, hard-to-debug code, which in turn may introduce new bugs or make the system harder to evolve with changing requirements. Always prioritize readability, correctness, and maintainability before optimizing for performance.

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil." — Donald Knuth

In fewer than 200 words, this quote by computer scientist Donald Knuth emphasizes that over-concern with optimizing code before it's necessary can lead to unnecessary complexity, harder maintenance, and potentially obscure actual performance bottlenecks. It suggests that programmers should focus on writing clear, correct, and maintainable code first, then optimize only when profiling and testing reveal a genuine need for improvement. This principle encourages a balanced approach to software development, prioritizing readability and functionality over speculative performance gains.

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

First, prioritize your tasks. When you're working on a project, it' s important to determine which tasks are most critical to the success of the project. By focusing on these tasks first, you can ensure that your code is of high quality and meets the requirements of your project timeline. You can use the MoSCoW method to categorize your task: Must have, Should have , Could have and Won't have.This will ensure you are focusing your efforts on the most important aspects of a task. 
 其次，明智地规划你的时间。在编程时，合理安排时间至关重要。你可以使用番茄工作法（Pomodoro Technique）来提高效率。这种方法包括25分钟的高效率工作，然后休息5分钟的循环。每完成四个番茄周期后，休息15-30分钟。这有助于保持注意力并避免疲劳。
 最后，保持组织。使用版本控制系统（如Git）和项目管理工具（如鱼骨图）可以帮助你保持对代码和项目的控制。定期备份你的代码，并确保你有详细的注释和文档，以便在需要时轻松找到和修改代码。 总之，通过优先处理任务，合理分配时间，并保持组织，你可以成为一名更高效的程序员。

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' - Donald Knuth. Focus on writing clear, maintainable code first. Optimize only when necessary, after profiling and identifying bottlenecks. Remember that simplicity, readability, and robustness are often as crucial as raw speed." 

In more detail, this quote emphasizes that striving to make parts of your program excessively efficient before they're proven to be a performance bottleneck can lead to complex, hard-to-understand code. This complexity can introduce bugs, hinder future development, and ultimately prove counterproductive if those optimizations don't significantly impact the overall performance of the application. Always consider the bigger picture and balance optimization with code quality and clarity.

- Today's programming wisdom: "Code is read far more often than it is written. Strive for clarity and maintainability in your work, as the true cost of software lies in its ongoing maintenance, not its initial creation." 

In practice, this means:
1. Write clean, well-structured code with clear naming conventions.
2. Use comments judiciously to explain complex logic or reasoning.
3. Adhere to SOLID principles and design patterns that promote flexibility and scalability.
4. Keep your functions small and focused; avoid over-complicated methods.
5. Remember that future you (or another developer) will appreciate good documentation and simplicity just as much as the end user benefits from a well-functioning application.
