- "Today's programming wisdom is to write code that is not only functional but also readable and maintainable. Invest time in planning, organizing your code structure, and using clear and descriptive names for variables and functions. This will make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand and work with your code. Remember, code is read more often than it is written, so prioritize readability."
